# 🏗️ Architecture Overview – Task Management REST API

This document outlines the high-level architecture of the **Task Management API**. The application is built using the Spring Boot framework, follows a layered architecture, and is containerized with Docker for portability and scalability.

---

## 📚 Design Principles

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer handles a specific responsibility.
- **Inversion of Control (IoC)** and **Dependency Injection (DI)** are used to manage dependencies.
- **RESTful Design**: Resources are exposed as REST endpoints.
- **DTO Pattern**: Used to decouple internal domain models from external API contracts.
- **Containerization**: Docker is used to package the application and its dependencies.

## 🔍 Layer Descriptions

### 1. **Controller Layer**

* Located in: `controller/`
* Responsibilities:

    * Exposes REST endpoints using Spring MVC
    * Handles HTTP requests/responses
    * Delegates to the Service layer

### 2. **Service Layer**

* Located in: `service/`
* Responsibilities:

    * Contains business logic
    * Acts as an intermediary between Controller and Repository
    * Transforms DTOs to Entities and vice versa

### 3. **Repository Layer**

* Located in: `repository/`
* Responsibilities:

    * Interacts with the database using Spring Data JPA
    * Provides CRUD operations for Task entities

### 4. **Model/Entity Layer**

* Located in: `model/`
* Responsibilities:

    * Represents the domain model (`Task`)
    * Maps to relational database tables

### 5. **DTO Layer**

* Located in: `dto/`
* Responsibilities:

    * Used to expose specific fields to the client
    * Helps with input validation and API versioning

## 🐳 Docker Architecture

```plaintext
+---------------------+      +-------------------------+
|    task-api         | <--> |       mysql-db          |
| (Spring Boot App)   |      |   (MySQL 8 Container)   |
+---------------------+      +-------------------------+
        |
        v
  Exposed at http://localhost:8080
```

* **Docker Compose** ensures both services run in isolated containers.
* Internal networking (`mysql-db:3306`) is used to connect the API to MySQL.
* Health checks ensure database readiness before bootstrapping the API.

---

## 🔧 Config & Environments

* App properties are configured via environment variables inside Docker.
* Spring Boot uses `application.properties` to load datasource config.
* Swagger is enabled for API exploration and testing.

---

## 📈 Future Improvements

* Add authentication (JWT or OAuth2)
* Implement pagination and filtering
* Add unit and integration tests
* Support for API versioning
* CI/CD with GitHub Actions or Jenkins

---

## 📌 Summary

This architecture allows for modular, testable, and scalable backend development using Spring Boot and Docker. It supports clean separation of concerns, making the codebase maintainable and easy to extend.
